# Let us discuss the formula for compound interest. The formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by: 

# A = P(1 + R/100) t 

# Compound Interest = A â€“ P 

# A is amount 
# P is the principal amount 
# R is the rate and 
# T is the time span


# def computndIntrest(p, r, t):
#     amount = p * (pow((1 + r/100),t))
#     compound = amount - p
#     print(compound)
# computndIntrest(10,5.1,13)
