# Simple interest formula is given by: Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100 Where, P is the principal amount T is the time and R is the rate

# Examples:

# Input : P = 10000
#         R = 5
#         T = 5
# Output :2500.0
# We need to find simple interest on 
# Rs. 10,000 at the rate of 5% for 5 
# units of time.


# def simpleInterest(P, T, R):
#     return (P * T * R)/100

# print(simpleInterest(10000,5, 5))
